### First of all make sure that you have turned on less secure app access on your account, [click here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) to turn it on.
### We must run *Init()* while starting the code, means at the time when you start to write down the code.
### We must always run the *fillDat()* after running *Init()* to avoid many errors.
### We must run *SendMail()* Whenever we want to send mail while executing.
### We need python so download it from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe)
